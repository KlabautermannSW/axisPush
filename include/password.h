    brief       encode() encodes a value typed in by the user to a string to be
                saved in the ini file.
                decode() decodes the string from the ini file to a plain text
                value.

    note        If your computer where this program is running on is accessible
                from outside your local network you should not save your ftp
                password using plain text.
                You can use these two functions to implement your own
                encoding/decoding algorithm.
